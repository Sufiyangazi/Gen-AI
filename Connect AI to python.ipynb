      "Python's memory management is very efficient, and it is rare for a program to run out of memory. However, if a program does run out of memory, it can be difficult to debug. This is because the garbage collector can run at any time, and it can be difficult to track which objects are being used and which ones are not.\n",

These risks could have a devastating impact on humanity, and it is important to be prepared for them.\n",
